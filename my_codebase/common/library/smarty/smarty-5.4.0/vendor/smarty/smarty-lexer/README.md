# Smarty Lexer/Parser generator

The "smarty/smarty-lexer" package is used to generate the lexer and parser class files for the [Smarty](https://github.com/smarty-php/smarty) project.

Since Smarty v3.1.35, the correct smarty/smarty-lexer is automatically configured using composer.

## Requirements
Smarty can be run with PHP 7.1 to PHP 8.2.
