ABOUT THE CODEBASE:

This all custom PHP MVC-codebase was developed by Ivan Mark Andersen back when it was normal to do that.

It was developed just for the fun of developing and to achive better object-oriented solutions and ofcause to ease the development of solid custom web-applications using the object-oriented server-side scripting language of PHP.

Ivan also used some of it, when he was applying for jobs as an example and prove of his skills and experience as a software developer.
- And even today it all works out of the box ;-)
